# Section 4: Population Scale Analysis

Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes. How many samples do we have?

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.csv")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

Lets make a boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(expr)+ aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno)+
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

The relative expression value between A\|A and G\|G are very different from looking at the boxplot. Having a G\|G in this location is highly associated with having reduced expression of the gene ORMDL3.
